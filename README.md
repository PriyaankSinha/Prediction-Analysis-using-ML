# Prediction Analysis using ML

ABSTRACT

The overwhelming increase in the Data in today's world demands more experts to handle 
this massive amount of data in all industries. It stands out that the companies need more 
Data Scientists and Data Engineers to design and code the algorithms. Having said that, we 
often confuse ourselves in the responsibilities shared between these two groups of experts. 
“Data Scientists” are the ones who primarily design algorithms that can serve as the foundation 
for different prediction models such as Neural Network, Linear and Logistic regression, etc. 
However, “Data Engineers” are the ones who code using the predefined prediction models and 
try to increase the accuracy in the results. This clearly shows that these two groups of experts 
i.e. Data Scientists and Data Engineers works in perfect harmony side-by-side to create 
impressive solutions to handle the ginormous amount of data produced each day.

This project provides a thorough walk-through of the steps required for the prediction analysis 
of the data including two different Machine Learning algorithms to design our model that are: 
a) Neural Network and b) Logistic regression on the same dataset. Additionally, we have 
discussed the Confusion Matrix, which predicts the accuracy of the designed models.
